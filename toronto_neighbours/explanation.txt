Business proposal: Company expansion to the west coast

It's one thing to operate a succesful company, but to begin its expansion
into new areas and potential markets is a vital step in taking a company
to the next level. Company A is a succesful coffee house and eatery 
established along the East Coast of the United States with its headquarters
sitting in upper New York. Its succseful business model and competitor
intelligence has allowed it to make great inroads into metropolitan areas, 
but the company are now looking for areas of market expansion, specifically
along the western seaboard, with an emphasis on thriving areas of
the LA region, such as Downtown. 
However, we know that success in one area is not always a certain indicator
for success elsewhere, coupled with the diverse socioeconomic and cultural
landscape of the LA region, more concrete measures are required to assess
Company A's potential expansion. 

To scope out the suitablity of this move Data Scientists are being employed
to evaluate LA neighbourhoods to try and answer the key following questions
regarding competitor activity in the downtown LA area.Establishing answers 
questions surrounding the current competitor landscape,
will be key in assessing the suitability of this area for a new business expansion.
